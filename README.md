# zk-research
Zero-Knowledge Research &amp; Benchmarking is a public hub for zk proofs, Noir, Aztec Private State, and cryptographic performance. It includes tutorials, benchmarking tests, UML diagrams, and zk implementations to analyze rollups, authentication, and transaction efficiency. Our goal is to introduce zk tech with open research and insights.
# Zero-Knowledge Research & Benchmarking

This repository serves as a **public knowledge hub** for Zero-Knowledge (zk) technology, focusing on:

- 🧑‍🏫 **Educational Tutorials** – Deep dives into zk proofs, Noir, Aztec Private State, authentication witnesses, and cryptographic fundamentals.  
- 📊 **Benchmarking & Performance Analysis** –  
  - **Micro-benchmarking**: Comparing zk circuit performance, u128 vs. u256 bit sizes, and proving time optimizations.  
  - **Transaction Efficiency**: Measuring zk rollup transactions vs. traditional finance (DeFi vs. TradFi benchmarks).  
  - **Product Feature Comparisons**: Evaluating zk-based authentication, private transactions, and scaling solutions.  
  - **Protocol Benchmarks**: Analyzing performance trade-offs between zk platforms like Aztec, Flare, zkSync, and Noir.  
- 🔬 **Code & Experiments** – Sample Noir contracts, Rust-based zk implementations, and real-world zk integrations.  
- 📑 **UML & Architecture Diagrams** – Visual explanations of zk systems, Merkle Trees, Aztec Noir state transitions, and authentication models.  
- 🛠 **zk Platform Research** – Comparative analysis of zk frameworks, DSLs, and infrastructure tools.  

🚀 **Goal**: To contribute to zk knowledge, showcase research, and provide practical benchmarking tools for developers, builders, product developers, product designers, and platform investor and bizdev specialist
